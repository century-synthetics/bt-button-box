# Schematics and PCB layouts

This project was kicked off to replace the Accuforce direct drive wheel's  button box PCB with a Bluetooth Low Energy HID button box controller. This project is DIY and derives much from the original Adafruit design with specific board shapes and pinouts for the steering wheel controls.

If you'd like to build one, the gerbers and schematics are freely available in this repository. They circuit can be easily forked and modified on the Circuitmaker repository here: <https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/century-synthetics/AFV2-Wireless-Button-Box-Mod>

The circuit is designed to be built by hand using 0805 surface mount parts or larger. It is a moderately challenging build due to the bluetooth QFN module. You can see the BOM folder for a parts list.
